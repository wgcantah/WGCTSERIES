\title{Convert Dataframe Numerical Columns to Time Series Format
This function converts the numerical columns of a dataframe into time series objects and combines them into a new dataframe.
In addition, a date variable is created based on the specified frequency and start time, which is then appended to the output.}
\usage{
tsset(df, frequency = 1, start = c(1, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing data. Non-numeric columns are ignored.}

\item{frequency}{An integer indicating the number of observations per unit time. Use:
\itemize{
\item \code{1} for yearly data,
\item \code{4} for quarterly data,
\item \code{12} for monthly data.
}
The default is \code{1}}

\item{start}{A numeric vector of length 2 indicating the start time of the series (e.g., \code{c(1, 1)} for the first year).
For monthly or quarterly data, the second element represents the starting period.}
}
\value{
A dataframe in which each numerical column from \code{df} has been converted to a time series object. An additional
\code{time} column is added that contains date values (of class \code{Date}) corresponding to each observation.
}

Convert Dataframe Numerical Columns to Time Series Format
This function converts the numerical columns of a dataframe into time series objects and combines them into a new dataframe.
In addition, a date variable is created based on the specified frequency and start time, which is then appended to the output.
}
\details{
The function first checks that the input is a dataframe and that it contains at least one numerical column.
It then converts each numerical column into a time series object using the base R \code{\link{ts}} function.
A time variable is created in decimal format and is converted into a proper date format according to the frequency:
\itemize{
\item For quarterly data (\code{frequency = 4}), the month is determined by \code{(quarter - 1) * 3 + 1}.
\item For monthly data (\code{frequency = 12}), the day is set to the first day of the month.
\item For yearly data (\code{frequency = 1}), the date is set to January 1st of the given year.
}
}
\examples{
 \dontrun{
# Example with monthly data:
df <- data.frame(
  sales = rnorm(24, mean = 100, sd = 10),
  profit = rnorm(24, mean = 20, sd = 5),
  category = letters[1:24]
)

# Convert numerical columns to a monthly time series starting in January 2020
ts_df <- tsset(df, frequency = 12, start = c(2020, 1))
head(ts_df)
}
#' @export
